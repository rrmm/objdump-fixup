Assuming the current system has a C compiler and make, run,

         $ make

to build and create output.

'testing-od-output' and 'testing-od-fixup-output' are the only outputs
that are directly comparable.  'diffs' contain the differences between
the two files.

'diffs.example' is the successful result from a run on an x86-64 host.

The only differences should be:
    1. .LXXX: labels
    2. jmp and branch instructions that target a label
    3. instructions that objdump adds a '#' comment to, where the
       comment includes an address+offset.  The target label may
       not exist in the disassembly.

The fixed-up output files will have more lines compared to the
original objdump output due to the insertion of the labels.  The
fixed-up output with the '-nm', or '-nam' options will have slightly
fewer lines than the fixed-up output because of removal of lines with
only machine code, but without any mnemonics.

$ make static-test

runs against an included objdump output and diffs against included files
of expected script output
